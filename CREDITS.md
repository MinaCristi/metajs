### Credits

- I learned a lot about Lisp from [Paul
Graham's articles](http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html).
- I used syntax of [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org/) as starting point for MetaJS syntax.
- Some ideas about implementing Lisp on top of Javascript are borrowed from [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript),
[Sibilant](https://github.com/jbr/sibilant) and [LispyScript](https://github.com/santoshrajan/lispyscript).
